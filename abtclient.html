								<h2>What is it</h2>
								<p>Solar Client is a modification to lunar client. Its made using the great work from the people over at Solar Tweaks. I thought id just take it a little futher and make a client branding out of it.</p>
								<p>Solar Client is solar tweaks work combined with lunar's client work and a little bit of my own modification of lunars assets to create Solar Client. if you like what you see and the effort i put into this, consider buying the client launcher and textures. If you dont, all the big stuff ( Not the lc texturepack ) are available for free <a href="https://github.com/Solar-Tweaks/Solar-Tweaks">here</a></p>
								<h2>The Future</h2>
								<p>If motivation comes, I might get in contact with the people behing solar tweaks for their branding and actually create solar client. This is still a possibility, although being 1 person going up against clients with huge development teams, and knowing nothing about client development myself, ill have to see what i can do to get this client actually produced. This is something that i really want to do, but it will probably have to wait untill i get enough resources and knowledge to make a good product. <br>Cheers,<br>  Cyamp</p>

							<h2>Solar Client</h2>
							<p>I essentially took Lunar client, modified some textures, and made this website as a joke. You can donate for the laugh but ive made it pretty clear that this is not my work. this is not meant to be serious.<br>        Cheers, <br>            Cyamp</p>
